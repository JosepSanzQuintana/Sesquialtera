Sesquialtera is a font for writing my own functional harmony analysis variant, although it is possible to use it for other kind of harmony notation. 

The glyphs are based on Libre Baskerville regular font family (Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida), with also a SIL open font license.

The font should be installed as usual in any system, and it is tested in musescore (https://musescore.org) and textedit. To use in text processors like Word it is necessary to explicitly enable OpenType features. 

Some times may be needed to disable text substitutions. You can make it easily in system/preferences/Idiom and region.

—USE OF THE FONT—
Normally we write our functional analysis writing the roman numerals, the function and, if needed, also the inversion. In this font you may type the roman numeral "naturally" typing combinations of I and V. For the tonic you will use mostly T or t, depending on the major/minor mode. 

After typing the grade you should write the function typing S, s, D or d, depending on the function you need (subdominant or dominant) and the major/minor quality of the third of the chord. 

If you need a first inversion, you may type also the number 6. If you want a second inversion you may also type first a 6 and second a 4 character. The font will position both numbers correctly. 

This workflow will be the same whatever notation you need, including sevenths, ninths, and all their inversions. 

There is also the possibility to form diminished fifth or seventh characters.
For example, if you want to write a diminished fifth, you should type "/ 5". The font transforms it to the traditional diminished fifth glyph. 

This writing process should be enough natural and comfortable. However there is some shortcuts to make typing faster:

To use complete glyphs for every grade in mode Major:
=> T Q W E R Y G
If you want a second inversion of it you should type the letter two times.

To use complete glyphs of minor grades:
=> t q w e r y g
And again to use the first inversion of them you have to type every letter two times. 

For T and R (tonic and fifth grade) you may type the letter three times and it will become a second inversion. 

The fifth grade have also the possibility to quickly become any of the inversions of a Dominant seven. Typing recursively the letter R it will show every inversion, always after the first and second inversion of the triad.

The augmented sixth have also some layers, that we'll have after typing A recursively, as follow:
=> Augmented sixth = A
=> Italian augmented sixth = A A
=> French augmented sixth = A A A
=> German augmented sixth = A A A A
=> Wagner augmented sixth = A A A A A

The napolitan sixth will show up typing the capital N.

Also the Double Dominant glyph is achieved typing two times letter D.

If you want to write a secondary dominant simply write at first the grade using V and I, and then use the slash character (/) and then the grade this dominant is refering to. After that you can write function and inversion.

Some times the music engraving software uses dash as a syllable separator. In this cases you may try typing endash (alt+dash) to write inversion changes with an horizontal line.
